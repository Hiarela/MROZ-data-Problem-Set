Labor Participation of Married Women in the United States: Probit and Logit Models - Quantitative Methods II Problem Set
This repository contains the materials for a problem set on labor participation among married women in the U.S. in 1975, created for the Quantitative Methods II course. The analysis uses the Mroz dataset, which includes 753 observations and 22 variables, covering information on hourly wages, hours worked, education, age, number of children, non-labor income, and labor participation.

Repository Contents:
1. Tarea_2_MCII_Enunciado.pdf: Problem set prompt with detailed questions and instructions.
2. Tarea_2_MCII_Pauta.pdf: Solution key with complete results, including model estimations, interpretations, and robustness checks.
3. PautaT2.Rmd: R Markdown script for performing the analyses outlined in the problem set, including data cleaning, visualizations, and estimation of Linear Probability, Probit, and Logit models.
4. T2_Pauta.do: Stata script to replicate the analysis, including data processing, modeling, and output generation.
5. /datos: Folder containing the Mroz dataset, which includes variables for demographic, economic, and family characteristics related to the labor participation of married women.

Instructions for Use:
1. Run PautaT2.Rmd: This R Markdown file executes the main analysis and creates a report with tables and visualizations based on the problem set requirements.
2. Run T2_Pauta.do: This Stata script performs the same analyses as the R script, allowing users to reproduce the results using Stata.
3. Consult the Tarea_2_MCII_Pauta.pdf: For guidance on interpreting the output, refer to the solution key.

Results Summary: 
This problem set analyzes the impact of various demographic and economic factors on the labor participation of married women, using a mix of Linear Probability, Probit, and Logit models. Results help illustrate the effects of education, non-labor income, and family structure on labor decisions.
